===============================================

<% if @type == "Review" %>
   Greetings <%= @content.shoutbox.user.vname %> we have a user by
   the name of <%= @content.user.vname %> who is creating some
   shouts on your page. As such I would like you to look over the
   shout message to see if it fits the bookgroup that it belongs
   to. Also by the way here is a url <%= @url %> to help you out
   for the review process. If you approve this shout it will be
   publicly visible for other to see, if you deny it then it will
   not be available to the public. I hope you will excercise good
   judment to keep our virtual pet site community safe for
   everyone. I leave the ruling up to you.
<% elsif @type == "Approved" %>
   The shoutbox owner <%= @content.shoutbox.user.vname %> has taken
   the time to look over your shout and has determined that it is
   okay to air to the public on her profile. The bookgroup that
   this shout belongs to feels correct for the bookgroup it belongs
   to. As such we have removed some points from your pouch to pay
   for this post.
<% elsif @type == "Denied" %>
   The shoutbox owner <%= @content.shoutbox.user.vname %> has taken
   the time to look over your shout and has determined that it
   doesn't fit into the correct bookgroup. Its okay things like
   this happen from time to time. All you need to do edit the shout
   and try again. We want to ensure that the content is suitable to
   our community.
