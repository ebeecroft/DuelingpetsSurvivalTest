===============================================

<% if @status == "Review" %>
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      Greetings <%= @content.blog.user.vname %>
   <% end %>
   we have a user by the name of <%= @content.user.vname %> who is
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      creating some replies on your blog. As such I would like you
      to look over the blogreply message to to see if it fits the
      bookgroup that it belongs to.
   <% end %>
   Also by the way here is a url <%= @url %> to help you out
   for the review process. If you approve this reply, it will then
   be publicly visible for others to see in that bookgroup. If you
   deny it, then it will not be publicly available. I hope you
   will excercise good judgment to keep our virtual pet site
   community safe everyone. I leave the ruling up to you.
<% elsif @status == "Approved" %>
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      The blog owner <%= @content.blog.user.vname %>
   <% end %>
   has taken the time to look over your reply and has determined that
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      it is okay to air to the public the message on their blog.
   <% end %>
   The bookgroup that the reply belongs to feels correct and as such
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      we have taken the opportunity to award the blog owner
      <%= @points %> points for their efforts.
   <% end %>
<% elsif @status == "Denied" %>
   <% if @type == "Blogreply" %>
      The blog owner <%= @content.blog.user.vname %>
   <% end %>
   has taken the time to look over your reply and has determined that
   it doesn't fit into the correct bookgroup. Its okay as things like
   this tend to happen from time to time. All you need to do is edit
   the reply and try again. We want to ensure that the content is
   suitable for our community.
