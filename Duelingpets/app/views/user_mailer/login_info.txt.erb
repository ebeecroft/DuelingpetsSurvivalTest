Login Information
===============================================

Greetings <%= @user.vname %> your initial password for the
site is <%= @password %> and is used to login after your
account has been activated. In addition to this you will
need to use your login name <%= @user.login_id %> as well,
but remember to keep your login name private. Your
activation token <%= @user.pouch.remember_token %> is only
used to activate your account. Your virtual name
<%= @user.vname %> is your public profile and identifies
you to the rest of the world.

This information should help you get started. There will
be a tutorial on the website that will explain how the
site works and additional parameters that haven't been
talked about yet. I hope you have fun exploring the site
and welcome to Duelingpets.
