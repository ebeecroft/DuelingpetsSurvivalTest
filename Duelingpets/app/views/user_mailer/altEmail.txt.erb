Need help with your password <%= @user.vname %>?
===============================================

So you came to visit Steford the Stoat about that
pesky password issue you were having. I also heard
that you can't access your original email
<%= @user.email %>. What did you say your name was
again? I am a bit old and my memory is not as sharp
as it once was. Ah yes <%= @user.vname %> your the
one that called upon me earlier. Let me fetch my
tools and I will see what I can do.

Well not bad I think this should work granted it is not
the best, still its pretty good for Stoat knowledge on
this thing. Heheee you humans are very silly creatures
always seeming to forget one thing or another. I must
say you could learn a thing or two from the squirrels
but that is neither here nor there. The new password
is <%= @user.password %>, please remember to change
this one, once you are back into your account. Also be
sure to update your email account as well. See you
later you one eyed seadog. Hahaha.
