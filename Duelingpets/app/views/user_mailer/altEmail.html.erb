      <h1>Need help with your password <%= @user.vname %>?</h1>
      <p>
         So you came to visit Steford the Stoat about that
         pesky password issue you were having. I also heard
         that you can't access your original email
         <%= @user.email %>. What did you say your name was
         again? I am a bit old and my memory is not as sharp
         as it once was. Ah yes <%= @user.vname %> your the
         one that called upon me earlier. Let me fetch my
         tools and I will see what I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
         Well not bad I think this should work granted it is not
         the best, still its pretty good for Stoat knowledge on
         this thing. Heheee you humans are very silly creatures
         always seeming to forget one thing or another. I must
         say you could learn a thing or two from the squirrels
         but that is neither here nor there. The new password
         is <%= @user.password %>, please remember to change
         this one, once you are back into your account. Also be
         sure to update your email account as well. See you
         later you one eyed seadog. Hahaha.
