      <h1>Login Information</h1>
      <p>Greetings <%= @user.vname %> your initial password for the
         site is <%= @password %> and is used to login after your
         account has been activated. In addition to this you will
         need to use your login name <%= @user.login_id %> as well,
         but remember to keep your login name private. Your
         activation token <%= @user.pouch.remember_token %> is only
         used to activate your account. Your virtual name
         <%= @user.vname %> is your public profile and identifies
         you to the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>This information should help you get started. There will
         be a tutorial on the website that will explain how the
         site works and additional parameters that haven't been
         talked about yet. I hope you have fun exploring the site
         and welcome to Duelingpets.
