   Greetings keymasters we have a new person who wishes
   to create an account on our website. Please be sure
   to check all details of the user's information to
   make certain that this user is not a bot. Here are
   a few tools that will help out with this:
   https://email-checker.net/, https://verify-email.org/,
   and https://tools.verifyemailaddress.io/.
<% elsif @type == "Bot" %>
   Greetings Admin we have discovered a bot that was
   hiding among the other users during the review
   process. We used the tools that you have gave us and
   we checked the registration very throughly and it
   seemed to fit the aspect of a bot. So we denied the
   bot entry and we hope the information about this
   particular bot reaches you.

<% if @type == "Review" %>
   As members of the keymaster group you are the last
   line of defence against bot attacks. I have built
   in a capcha, a bot blacklist, the registration
   process and an activation process to help you out.
   Its why your role is quite important, you are the
   manual control line that determines whether users
   are allowed into the site or not. To access this
   review section you will need to follow this url
   <%= @url %>. Also I added a keymaster control
   pannel to make things easier for you. If you have
   any questions you can always ask me for help. I
   wish you the best of luck.

   <%= @registration.vname %>, Login_id:
   <%= @registration.login_id %>, Country:
   <%= @registration.country %>, Country timezone:
   <%= @registration.country_timezone %>. We hope
   the data that we collected can now be used to
   prevent future bot attacks based on the
   information that we sent.
