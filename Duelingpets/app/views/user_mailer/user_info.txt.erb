===============================================

<% if @type == "Welcome" %>
   Hehehe hello there <%= @user.vname %> I am Glitchy the
   Dragon your helpful little tour guide. Not what you
   were expecting that's okay. Well one doesn't meet a
   dragon like me very often, you might even say I am a
   bit of a glitch. Now the Admin of this site invited me
   in and well I have set up a bit of a shop here. I call
   it the dragonhoard and I take great care to see how
   well the economy of the game is managed.
<% elsif @type == "Info" %>
   Well hello there <%= @user.vname %> I am sure your
   curious about the contents of your account. I
   Bartholumu Bat will guide you. Avatars are images
   that define you as an individual. Vname or virtual
   name is your main handle to the outside world,
   some of these may contain symbols next to them to
   represent their privilege level. Privilege levels
   by default are normally users, but others may be
   reviewers, keymasters or others.
<% elsif @type == "Findlogin" %>
   Sera the Shrew here, so it seems you misplaced
   your login name once again little bat. You really
   should consider investing in some glasses to see
   better dear. No matter I am happy to help you
   locate it.
<% elsif @type == "Resetpassword" %>
   So you came to visit Steford the Stoat about that
   pesky password issue you were having. What did
   you say your name was again? I am a bit old and
   my memory is not as sharp as it once was. Ah yes
   <%= @user.vname %> your the one that called upon
   me earlier. Let me fetch my tools and I will see
   what I can do.
<% elsif @type == "Resettime" %>
   Mortica Mouse here you must be the one requesting
   more time weren't you. I thought as much
   <%= @user.vname %>, I will see if I can roll back
   the clock just a tad. Time magic tends to be very
   exhausting you know and as a wizard in training
   I know that quite well. Let me consult my spell
   book and I will see what I can do.
<% end  %>

   Still being a glitch dragon does have some downsides
   playing games can be quite challenging when your
   programming has other plans. I can't remember how many
   times I played megaman 4 only to have the floor
   disappear under megaman, oops. Yeah that is kind of a
   thing. Still I am quite happy to be here and meet new
   people. I help out the admin in developing all kinds
   of new features so that is kind of why I am a bit of a
   beta tester. Anyways I hope you have fun and enjoy
   playing around the site.
<% elsif @type == "Info" %>
   Now writing groups define what content as user you can
   create as such based on the age you selected during
   registration. As you grow older this writing  group
   will change over time, for example if you are originally
   Peter Rabbit and you are old enough to be a Bluelander,
   your writing group reflects this new change. Reading
   groups on the other hand reflect what type of content
   the user wishes to see. By default all users are normally
   set to Peter Rabbit which is the lowest group of the six.
   Reading groups can be changed to what ever group the user
   wishes to be in that is equal to their writing group or
   less than it. Thats all I have time to tell you young
   one, best of luck to you.
<% elsif @type == "Findlogin" %>
   Sera chuckles. Well looks like I found it. It was under
   your little leaf bed. Its okay youngen sometimes these
   things happen. Even little Twinks bat at times has
   difficulty in finding his toys. He is quite a cutie
   though. Tell him I say hi. Oh by the way your
   Login name is: <%= @user.login_id %>. I hope to see you
   again little bat. She then proceeds to give you a kiss
   before leaving.
<% elsif @type == "Resetpassword" %>
   Well not bad I think this should work granted it is not
   the best, still its pretty good for Stoat knowledge on
   this thing. Heheee you humans are very silly creatures
   always seeming to forget one thing or another. I must
   say you could learn a thing or two from the squirrels
   but that is neither here nor there. The new password
   is <%= @user.password %>, please remember to change
   this one, once you are back into your account. See you
   later you one eyed seadog. Hahaha.
<% elsif @type == "Resettime" %>
   Whew that was quite exhausting I hope bought you enough
   time. I had to mutter quite a few words of power to
   reset and now I am quite winded. At least I was able to
   get you this new token: <%= @user.pouch.remember_token %>.
   Please remember to enter this code to activate your account.
   Have fun.
